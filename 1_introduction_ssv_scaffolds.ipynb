    "# Introduction to Subject-Specific Vagus Scaffolds\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject-Specific Vagus (SSV) Scaffolds created for the SPARC REVA Phase 2 project are a specialized Finite Element Model which defines a consistent coordinate system for the volume of the human vagus trunk, with arbitrary numbers of branches radiating out from starting locations embedded in the trunk/parent branch volume. Each scaffold is defined with three coordinate fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `coordinates` fitted to the geometry the scaffold was fitted, usually the excised configuration stitched from micro-CT segmentations. The trunk also includes fitted orientation/twist and radius where data has been provided. Branches are fitted to provided path data.\n",
    "2. `straight coordinates`, a version of the geometric coordinates using the same scale but with the trunk going straight down the z-axis, and all twist removed so that the x-axis is anatomically left and y-axis is the anterior direction, centred at x, y = (0, 0). Branches radiate out in their starting anatomical directions.\n",
    "3. `vagus coordinates`, an invariant 'material' coordinate system for the trunk of all subjects, with the z/3-axis giving a normalized measure down the vagus from 0.0 near the brainstem to 1.0 at full length but actually calibrated by level markers at fixed locations down its centroid. These coordinates have fixed radius giving an aspect ratio equivalent to 3mm diameter of nerve epineurium over 500mm length.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SSV coordinate fields](images/ssv_3_coordinate_fields.png \"Subject-Specific Vagus Scaffolds, from left-to-right 1. coordinates, 2. straight coordinates, 3. vagus coordinates (unit length)\")\n",
    "**Figure 1. Subject-Specific Vagus Scaffold coordinates** From left-to-right: 1. coordinates, 2. straight coordinates, 3. vagus coordinates (scaled from unit length). Translucent surfaces show the round equivalent-area epineurium surface, but the bounds of the scaffold is a box of twice these dimensions to enclose the true cross-section shape and nearby tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boxes along the vagus trunk and branches in Figure 1 are 3-D hexahedral finite elements with local coordinate systems spanning from 0.0 to 1.0 along three directions down the vagus, left and up. These are entirely defined as functions of coordinate position and direction parameters along the centroid of the trunk and branches, and 2-D epineurium surfaces and 1-D centroid lines are defined from the same parameters. The start of each branch is defined  by general linear mapping of parent/trunk parameters making them fully embedded or built-in to their host at that point, preserving their relative directions when the scaffold is fitted to other configurations such as in-body trace data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the specialized nature of these models and the esoteric EX file format it is easiest to extract information by evaluating it using the [cmlibs.zinc library API](https://cmlibs.org/documentation/api), or **Zinc** from its Python interface. This can be installed via pip:"
